This is an attempt to recreate the [nervous matrix](https://bit101.github.io/lab/dailies/170313.html) from [Yugop Nakamura](http://yugop.com/).

The result can be found [here](https://objective-stonebraker-0ae68d.netlify.com).

I used the book [Physics for JavaScript Games, Animation, and Simulations: with HTML5 Canvas](https://www.amazon.com/Physics-JavaScript-Games-Animation-Simulations/dp/1430263377) to learn how to implement physics in JavaScript.
